Tired of the same old normal palette? Wish you could give each of your apps that distinctive stamp, marking you as a creative person? Try Appstagram. It's the hip new way to use your apps.

Why use an app like normal, when you can use it in a nostalgic sepia tone? It's like facial hair for your apps. Why see your apps normally, when you can see them slightly blurry.

Appstagram makes your apps the coolest.

To use Appstagram you must first install SIMBL from http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php
